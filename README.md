# MNIST web using onnxjs

The demo website can be found [there](https://matthieu-sgi.github.io/mnist-onnxjs/).

To use the website, allow the use of camera.
Then you have to center the number you want to predict in the small square (below the big camera sqare).
The small square is a crop of a big one with applied transformations, this represent the input of the model.
The argmax prediction is displayed below.
